# CircadianDna_FHE

A **privacy-preserving DNA-based personalized circadian rhythm coaching platform** that allows users to submit encrypted genomic data. Leveraging **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**, the AI coach can analyze circadian rhythm-related genes and provide lifestyle recommendations without exposing sensitive genetic information.

## Project Background

Circadian rhythms play a critical role in sleep, metabolism, and overall health. Personalized recommendations based on genetic data can improve well-being, but traditional genomic analysis raises significant privacy concerns:

- Users may hesitate to share raw DNA sequences due to confidentiality and misuse risks  
- Centralized systems are vulnerable to data breaches  
- Current solutions require trusting third parties with sensitive genomic data  

**CircadianDna_FHE** addresses these challenges by allowing computation directly on encrypted genetic data. Users receive actionable insights while retaining complete privacy over their DNA information.
